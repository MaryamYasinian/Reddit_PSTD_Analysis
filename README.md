# Reddit PTSD Analysis (ongoing)

My project explores which word(s) describes Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) for people impacted by PTSD. Using data collected from a Reddit discussion with 214 user responses, I analyzed how individuals living with PTSD articulate their experiences.

As a healthcare researcher and data analyst, I'm building this project out of a passion for understanding mental health and human expression. 

# Tools & Techniques
- Reddit API for automated comment extraction
- Python for data collection, text processing, statistical analysis and visualization
- SQL for data organization, joining tables, querying
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text cleaning, lemmatization, and linguistic analysis
  
# What my Project Does
- Collects real-world Reddit responses about PTSD
- Cleans and preprocesses text to remove noise and irrelevant tokens
- Identifies key words, emotions, and adjectives that describe trauma
- Analyzes word frequency and expression patterns in single-word and multi-word responses
- Extracts insights into how trauma is linguistically expressed by individuals
- Visualize the findings
